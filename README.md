## Description

After I manually configured my personal server, I thought about the best way to monitor it.
The first thing that came to my mind was the utopia that the server monitored itself.
It would tell me who (at least the IP direction) is trying to connect to the the server as it happens whitout me having to login in and checking every time.
It would even give me the option to turn offor restart remotely the server at any time, but specially when such fraudulent behaviour is detected.
I would be able to do internet speed tests,
